- Deployed the trained model to simulate real-world applications, such as automatic photo tagging.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) & Transformers**  
**Project: Text Translation and Sentiment Analysis using Transformers**  
- Developed an **NLP model** to analyze **sentiment of movie reviews** in three languages: **English, French, and Spanish**.
- Merged multiple CSV files containing movie reviews, synopses, and metadata into a unified **pandas dataframe**.
- Used **HuggingFace Transformers** to translate French and Spanish reviews into English for unified analysis.
- Applied **pretrained transformers** to perform **sentiment classification (Positive/Negative)** on each review.
- Generated a final **CSV report** containing columns for **Title, Year, Synopsis, Review, Sentiment, and Original Language**.
